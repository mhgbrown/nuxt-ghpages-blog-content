Dis Wïk's Stuff
===============

Berlin is nice. I went there again this weekend and checked some more
shit out. I'm trying to get the vibe of Berlin. I'm not there yet. So
far, it's making me feel pretty damn good. Berlin "is a living city" as
one friend put it. It's not necessarily a beautiful city, but who gives
a fuck. It's really fucking cool.

I'm liking these places that have somewhat recently come out of
significant repression --- they're progressing, they're innovating,
they're interesting, and they're fun. The memories of this repression
are good motivators. I went to a free museum called the ["Topography of
Terror"](http://www.topographie.de/)  near [Checkpoint
Charlie](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=Checkpoint+Charlie%2C+Berlin%2C+Germany&data=!4m15!2m14!1m13!1s0x47a851d15c26d8cd%3A0x23a50042477d89c8!3m8!1m3!1d31549231!2d-95.677068!3d37.0625!3m2!1i1680!2i929!4f13.1!4m2!3d52.507593!4d13.390368)
and I finally understood how fucked up the whole Nazi thing was.  Of
course, the Berlin wall also has a massive historical presence and I was
constantly reading about the division of Germany and even talked to some
Germans that had lived in eastern Germany throughout the period. Man,
what a time. I'm not knowledgeable enough to "empathize", but I've
gotten enough of an idea to feel deeply weirded out by it.It's insane
that the whole thing comes crashing down with a [misinterpretation of a
note](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_inner_German_border#Opening_of_the_border_and_the_fall_of_the_GDR)
and [these few words](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8GzptqhT68). 
People do ridiculous things to each other. Incredible.

-   For some sort of comp sci thing, there was free Glüwein (hot spiced
    wine) in the comp sci building. This was an excellent treat after my
    exam last Thursday. I think they have it elsewhere on campus, but
    you must pay for it.
-   I have finally opened a bank account here. Jeez.
-   You are allowed to change your place of birth if it was in a
    particularly "shameful" place in Germany, for example, Dachau where
    there was a [notorious concentration
    camp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dachau_concentration_camp).
-   I danced under an indoor community pool! There's a club in Berlin
    called ["Stattbad"](http://www.stattbad.net/), which is situated
    under a decommissioned community pool. It's pretty industrial
    looking inside as you might imagine --- lots of concrete, lots of
    pipes, some low ceilings, etc. It has a fantastic atmosphere for
    techno. 
-   I stayed in [The Cat's Pajamas
    hostel](http://www.thecatspajamashostel.de/) in Berlin, which is
    situated in Neukölln (aka a cool hood). I'd highly recommend it.
    It's has many accommodation options and lots of new amenities. It's
    clean, comfortable, and cheap. While I was there, it celebrated its
    one-year opening anniversary with free alcohol and food --- a nice
    way to kick off the weekend.
-   [Coffeeshops a la Amsterdam may open in
    Berlin](http://rt.com/news/marijuana-berlin-shop-opens-462/) in an
    attempt to curb drug dealing that occurs in [Görlitzer
    Park](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!data=!1m4!1m3!1d5877!2d13.4380442!3d52.4965481!4m12!2m11!1m10!1s0x0%3A0xdbc06edbfb7867fc!3m8!1m3!1d26081603!2d-95.677068!3d37.0625!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1).
    That would be quite interesting.

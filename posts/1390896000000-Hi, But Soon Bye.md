Hi, But Soon Bye
================

It's been some weeks again.  I'm finishing up my time in Dresden, and
for that matter, in Germany.  I'm starting to feel the weight of my
impending departure --- not excited to say goodbye to the people I'll be
leaving behind, not excited to be far from Berlin, not excited to be in
a city that's "a lesser transit hub". I'm leaving Dresden on the 17th of
February, taking a long-ass train ride to Vienna to attend a [student
workshop](http://logic.at/emclworkshop14/) for my Masters. Later, I'll
head straight for
[Bolzano](https://www.google.de/maps/preview/place/Bolzano,+Italy/@46.4892366,11.3471577,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47829c2b419e7049:0x652b694f348b432a),
where after some introductory couchsurfing, I'll find myself again
nestled in the impoverished charm of student living --- in a
[dorm](http://www.rainerum.it/home/) that "dictates" that you can only
make breakfast in the kitchen and can't have people in your room after
23:00.  What a load of total bullshit. I'll probably get kicked out. 

I spent last Saturday/Sunday in Berlin, which I realize could be my last
time in a while. As usual, had a surreal and congenial experience.  I
really want to just live it up for my last couple weeks here, but need
to balance pending examinations.  There's also a few things that I still
want to see around here --- [Saxon
Switzerland](https://www.google.de/maps/preview/place/Saxon+Switzerland/@50.9333327,14.2,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4709a6852463563b:0xe7787b6d81b3e8f0), [the
Leipzig
zoo](https://www.google.de/maps/preview/place//@51.3509575,12.3680836,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x84f9c448d8df3ff4),
and [Görlitz](https://www.google.de/maps/preview/place/gorlitz+germany/@51.13999,14.9649354,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4708dc31a78fee7f:0x5e9effc1a38b3b57) for
example. I will at most be done on the 13th of February, so I have some
time to get this stuff in.

-   I have unofficially accepted an offer to intern at
    [Sumall](https://sumall.com/) in New York City this Summer. I'm
    stoked. I need to holla at my NYC konnektions.
-   I've also manage to get some part-time work here in Dresden, helping
    someone get a prototype going for their startup idea. It's great to
    be learning some new stuff and makin some cash.
-   Some of [*Inglourious Basterds* was filmed in
    Görlitz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6rlitz#G.C3.B6rlitz_in_popular_culture).
-   Haven't written about [vk.com](http://vk.com/) yet, which is weird.
    I should have a while ago. It's like "Russian" Facebook, except it
    has tons of perhaps "questionably legal" media that you can stream
    and download for free.
-   How did I get my internship in NYC? Well, I used
    [hired.com](https://hired.com/).  You fill out a profile describing
    your work experience, what you'd like to do, blah blah blah and then
    you are entered into an "auction", in which employers can "bid" on
    you. A bid is more like an invitation to interview with some
    preliminary tastes of what real employment might offer.  Right now,
    the site seems to be oriented around the tech industry in the United
    States, but is expanding!
-   [Joseph Beuys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Beuys), a German
    artist, said \"Jeder mensch ein kunstler\" or "Everyone is an
    artist"
-   Check out this short Norwegian documentary,
    [WHATEVEREST](http://vimeo.com/58444378), which examines the
    inspiration behind Todd Terje's famous [Inspector
    Norse](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebjXsc0UjdQ). Even if you're
    not into electronic music, this song will sound familiar.
-   There's a small-ish "underground" club
    [here](https://www.google.com/maps/preview/place//@52.5007022,13.4728237,673m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x47a84efa91629327:0x39cba96b39c972ee?hl=en)
    and you should try to go. It has a wonderful vibe, great music, and
    a huge chill-out room. Just knock!

Wow, I'm almost done with this part.

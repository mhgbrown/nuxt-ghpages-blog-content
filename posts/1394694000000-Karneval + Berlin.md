Karneval + Berlin
=================

I'm in Berlin, I'm kind of settled, I'm looking for some German classes
and I'm doing a little exploring. So far, I've become obsessed with
[this little
cafe](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Leuchtstoff+-+Kaffeebar/@52.4677806,13.4322653,16z/data=!4m7!1m4!3m3!1s0x47a8458b312a13cd:0x3033709913e2f96a!2zTmV1a8O2bGxu!3b1!3m1!1s0x0:0xd49a28d4a6be518)
in my
[neighborhood](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Neuk%C3%B6lln/@52.445912,13.4617911,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47a8458b312a13cd:0x3033709913e2f96a),
which has elevated couches and even a bed. I'm also lucky to have a
[recently-closed-airport-turned-free-park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Berlin+Tempelhof+Airport/@52.4741647,13.4034028,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47a84fe8c5153a9b:0xb4e716f66e9829a9) nearby,
which I've already had the pleasure of running in. I'm digging the area.

Two weeks ago I had the opportunity to check out [Karneval in
Cologne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne_Carnival) with some native
Colognians, which was awwwweeesoooooommmmeeeee.  Lots of fun and
drinking and dancing and talking and meeting and eating and stuff. Rul
nice. Then I visited [my bae](http://brandonoxendine.com/) in
[Charleston, South
Carolina](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Charleston,+SC/@32.8210454,-79.9704779,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x88fe7a42dca82477:0x35faf7e0aee1ec6b)
for a week.  I haven't been back to the US since October, so it was a
bit of "whoa".  Now I'm back and ready to get a lil entrenched in the
Berlin thang.

-   [Kölle Karneval!](http://www.koeln.de/tourismus/karneval) To be
    honest with you, I had not even heard of this celebration before I
    came to Germany. Turns out, it's awesome (oh, surprise!) and didn't
    strike me as touristy. The city goes crazy! Everyone, young and old,
    is out in costume getting wasted on Kölsch and dancing in the
    street...for a week. I just stayed for the first day, which is
    apparently "the best day" as Karneval-goers are becoming
    increasingly exhausted as the festivities progress.
-   [Kölsch!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6lsch_(beer)) ...is a
    type of beer from Cologne (FYI Cologne = Köln in German) that is
    consumed in LARGE quantities during Karneval.  There are *many*
    kölsch producers, in fact, my friend told me it is the type of beer
    with the most producers. It's typical to drink this beer out of a
    0,2L glass, which is like 4 shots.  This makes it dangerously easy
    to consume a lot quickly.
-   [Kölsch (the
    language)!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6lsch_language) ...is
    a "dialect of German" that is native to Cologne and I guess not
    super intelligible by German speakers.  There are few people that
    speak it natively in Cologne and most other people seem to know a
    few words or phrases. As I remember, some of the traditional songs
    of Karneval involve Colognian.
-   "Kölle Alaaf!" is a thing that you say during Karneval as a
    greeting, chant, etc.  It means "Cologne above all!\" in Kölsch.
    It's sometimes chanted as a call and response thing: \"Kölle!" ---
    "Alaaf!"
-   [Mettbrötchen!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mett) ...is a
    traditional food of Karneval, which is raw pork on a sliced bread
    roll. I had it with butter, onions, salt and pepper and I fucking
    loved it. Seriously, I was on this food's nuts.  The idea of eating
    raw pork is admittedly a little scary, but I had no issues at all.
    It was just fucking delicious.
-   Random...you can't modify your car without getting it inspected. I'm
    not sure to what extent this is, but there are definitely way fewer
    tricked out cars on the road. Something about safety, blah, blah,
    blah, whatever.

TINGS I'VE LEARND THIS WEAK
===========================

This long weekend was wonderful and weird and poignant for reasons that
I can and cannot disclose.  Last Thursday was a holiday called
"Reformation Day" and I have no class on Friday. I want to highlight
one experience in particular that felt special to me that occurred last
Thursday.

On Wednesday night, a couple of my German friends were contemplating an
impromptu trip
to [Leipzig](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=leipzig+germany&data=!1m4!1m3!1d192948!2d12.3936349!3d51.3417825!4m12!2m11!1m10!1s0x47a6f818200f2c73%3A0x93df80d2b9b4f552!3m8!1m3!1d26081603!2d-95.677068!3d37.0625!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1) to
see [Marcel
Dettman](http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/marceldettmann) who is a
resident DJ of the (in?)famous [Berghain](http://www.berghain.de/) in
Berlin. Initially, it seemed that we were not going to go, but upon
realizing that Leipzig might be more of an adventure, decided that we
should. We left Dresden at 22:00 or 23:00, I don't remember. On the
train, I was introduced 4 German dudes who I would end up hanging out
with for the rest of the night/day. In Leipzig we crashed a house party
for a bit and then headed to [Distillery](http://www.distillery.de/),
where Marcel would be playing. In the club I ended up talking with one
of the guys, Lion, for something like two hours about random
philosophical/political things all the while listening to super bomb-ass
techno.  Everything at the club was great and we left around 10:00 or
11:00 to chill in some park before our departure.

At 14:00 we caught a train going back to Dresden.  Lion had decided to
stay in Leipzig with Españolas and two of the other German guys had
passed out.  I had been sleeping for a bit and then woke up to find the
4th guy, Falco, awake.  Falco and I started talking about random things.
I wasn't a very good conversation partner because I was in a *fucking
grog.  *Eventually, he brought up American Beauty and described his
favorite moment in the movie where one of the characters describes life
being so beautiful that it makes him want to cry. After Falco described
this, he assumed some sort of sad thinkers pose. I almost fucking broke
down and balled right there.  I probably not going to describe this
well, but there was something about being under extreme exhaustion and
the afterglow of the party drug with the saxony countryside rushing by
under the autumn afternoon sun that got to me deep in that moment.  All
the decisions and experiences that had brought me to that point came
rushing back and I remembered how profoundly sad it was to leave all the
things and people that I loved behind. And simultaneously I thought
about all the amazing experiences and adventures that I have already had
in this month abroad. And that this is how life is beautiful.  It's
adventures and risks and being vulnerable and lost and finding your way
continuously. It's incredible.

-   Halloween is *sort of* a thing here. You can definitely see people
    wearing all variety of costumes and throwing house parties. It's
    just that not everyone is doing it. I didn't dress up.
-   I have my first logic test tomorrow. :(
-   Although my trip to Leipzig was free with my student card, I
    couldn't ride the public transportation there for free.
-   I have the hardest fucking time finding heavy cream, which is
    "Sahne" or "Schlagsahne".  It doesn't seem like it's something that
    most stores carry. It doesn't come in any package that looks like
    milk. All the packages that I have seen so far have been different.
     I just used one that looked like a Yoplait container.
-   In bars and clubs and other places, you can turn in your beer bottle
    for a pretty hefty rebate, like 50 euro cents...which means its
    pretty easy to get a free beer just by hunting around for empty
    bottles.
-   I had German nannies when I was *really *young and I am going to
    reunite with one later this week!  We had a brief phone conversation
    the other day, during which she told me that I loved to stare at the
    ocean in [Morro
    Bay](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=morro+bay&data=!1m4!1m3!1d62961!2d-120.8460475!3d35.3780815!4m12!2m11!1m10!1s0x80ece10bb9b5aa93%3A0xaa1be219c181970c!3m8!1m3!1d26081603!2d-95.677068!3d37.0625!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1) and
    listen to some buoy that would make a weird howling noise.  I've
    always loved to stare at the ocean, so maybe this explains it. I'm
    excited to learn more about myself.

Leaving LinkedIn
================

Last Thursday was my last day at LinkedIn and it was definitely sad for
me. LinkedIn is a great place to work and I met a lot of very
intelligent and talented people there.  I was lucky enough to have the
opportunity to work on and launch the new profile and university pages.
 It was a great professional experience for me.

Generally, it's hard for me to divine how much I am valued at a company,
both as a competent technical contributor and as a good team member. My
exit from LinkedIn demonstrated that I had much more clout that I had
thought.  I had loads of people wishing me well and some urging me to
stay, even threatening to offer "illegal" deals.  My coworkers set up a
going away party at [Lucky Strike](http://www.bowlluckystrike.com/) last
Thursday. And then some of them even surprised me at my "official" going
away event on the next Friday. My intention is not to gloat; I just feel
so, so honored and flattered by the actions and intentions of my
colleagues.

I wish the best for LinkedIn and everyone there (aka better keep my
fucking stock valuable :) )

Ha, Things I've Learned This Week
=================================

I'm losing myself here and I like it.  This doesn't feel like a vacation
anymore. This is home. I'm meeting a lot of people and becoming more
integrated within both my German and academic circles.  I've met so many
nice, smart, cool, friendly people, I'm just sort of taken aback.  It's
fucking incredible.  Of course, this is just the beginning, so I'm sure
I'll be seeing some true colors in the coming weeks. 

My first day of class was yesterday. So far, pretty good I guess. The
concept of "strings" was reintroduced to me, but from a computational
logic perspective. I found that I quickly would need to adjust how I
think about computation. This is not a programming course. 

![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0acc7d23509b4e4dd462a239f4e25dc8/tumblr_inline_muph0wUYul1rctsd6.png)

So yeah, more of this to come.

-   So I hella fucked up. Berlin is not in Saxony. LOL.  Live and learn.
    But, it's just a 10 euro ride share away.
-   [This is a thing that considers itself a country that I didn't know
    existed.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abkhazia)
-   Google translate has come in handy a lot lately as I've been
    interacting increasingly with government and university officials
    that don't speak English. Got to get that shit RIGHT.
-   Germans seems to know a lot about the U.S. They know more about it
    than I do. I'm embarrassed.
-   I love [this cafe](http://www.wohnzimmer-dresden.de/) in Neustadt
    that has super antique furniture and plays rap. They have fucking
    excellent drinks.
-   I've lost \~10 lbs. Yeah. I'm generally eating less and walking A
    LOT. This is my best guess as to why.
-   Food is hella cheap...still. Whatever.
-   Yelp is, for the most part, worthless. Google Maps has been my goto
    thing, not necessarily for reviews, but just for discovery. There is
    an app called
    [Qype](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/qype/id299229792) that is
    equivalent. Unfortunately, I am unable to download it because I
    can't switch stores because I still have an active iTunes Match
    subscription. Dumb.
-   There is an extensive tram system in Dresden, but Google Maps does
    not know how to use it to route you places. It knows about the stops
    and what trams stop at them, but I guess nothing about the times. I
    want to change that.
-   The government gives 150 euros to students starting in Dresden.
    Hollar.
-   I am finishing the steps to open a bank account with
    [comdirect](http://www.comdirect.de/). They were running a promotion
    where, if you execute 3 or 4 transactions within 3 months, they give
    you 100 euros. More free money. Yay.
-   The internet in my dorm has a limit on it. I am using
    [backblaze](http://www.backblaze.com/) to back up all my shit to the
    cloud, which was chewing through my bandwidth limit as it proceeded
    to upload data at a theoretical rate of 66GB/day. Right now, my
    internet is blocked, although I should have received another
    allowance of gigabytes.  Not sure what is happening. Luckily my
    roommate is the network admin for my building so I'll just go to
    him.   Anyways, the limit fucking sucks. A lot. Like, a lot. Like
    COME ON.
-   Jesus, the party here is just some next level shit. I found out I
    could dance for 9 hours last Saturday, well actually Sunday.  The
    music is so great, the people are hella approachable, and it just
    keeps goooooiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnngggggggggggg.
-   Point of pride: called out in the club for being Spanish by a
    Spanish girl who then, upon realizing I was not, asked if I was
    Italian, all the while speaking the most fluent-ass Spanish I have
    in a while. I think being in Germany has re-primed my Spanish
    speaking skills, which is awesome. It also helps that some of my
    classmates are from Spanish-speaking countries and I talk to them
    occasionally in Spanish. SPANISH OK?

Whew, good lawrd, this is getting cool.

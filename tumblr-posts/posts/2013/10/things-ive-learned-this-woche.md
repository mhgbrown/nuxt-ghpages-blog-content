Things I've Learned This Woche
==============================

Hello, I've just finished my first week of class and so far it has been
pretty good. In one of my initial lectures I was super confused.  The
professor presented us with these slides

![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/02edd77cbe046dbd2a8f0960f77b505f/tumblr_inline_mv0psjv5VQ1rctsd6.png)

![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9ca4ade2da93880716e341deac0d838a/tumblr_inline_mv0pssdxtY1rctsd6.png)

and told us to do some exercise and I was like WTF BRO? Turns out we
were just defining the symbols that we will be using to deal with
propositional logic. So meta. Then we started talking about
the *interpretation *of the symbols to come up with some sort of final
"truth value".  

![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b50d09f413366eb25645c64e099f47aa/tumblr_inline_mv0py7ynZ71rctsd6.png)

And then I was like, "Hey, this is exactly like a computer program, just
like, in logic form and executed by the human brain".  Pretty cool I
think.  I love seeing the parallels between this stuff and programming.
It honestly sort of excites me...weird.  It also bolsters my confidence
in my decision to do this whole program in the first place. 

I'm developing my routines, I'm getting even *more *comfortable.

-   Between German and all this logic buisness, so many foreign symbols
    and words in my life right now, I'm dying.
-   ...like this table
-   ![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d22df7ef9ba346469c5f2dd019be1f30/tumblr_inline_mv0pnf07481rctsd6.png)
-   The word for cool, "geil" (guy-ehl), is also the word for horny.
     I\'m *sort of *trying to be careful with using it.
-   After a lecture completes, it's customary to knock on the table with
    your fist to show appreciation. This is just so weird for me.
-   There is a machine in the basement of my dorm building, next to the
    laundry room, that sells pocket pussies. Super geil.
-   I'm learning that I will just have to deal with all my shit smelling
    like smoke. It's not a battle I can win. People are smoking
    everywhere, in the klub, in the bar, in the restaurant, blah, blah,
    blah.  
-   I've been using [Hola Unblocker](https://hola.org/) to access sites
    like Hulu and Netflix abroad. It's available as a Chrome extension,
    it's super easy to use, and works wonderfully.
-   Italy requires something called a ["Declaration of Equivalent
    Value"](http://www.study-in-italy.it/studying/info-07.html), which
    is a thing that essentially validates your education.
     Unfortunately, it requires your degree(s) to be notarized by
    fucking every fucking person on earth *and* translated into Italian.
     I'm exploring how to get this done. Maybe I've overhyped it.
-   I don't have class on Friday for the first time in my full-time
    academic career. Cray.
-   Seriously, had the best pasta of my life

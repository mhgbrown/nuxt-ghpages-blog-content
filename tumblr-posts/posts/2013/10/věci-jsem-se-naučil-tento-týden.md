Věci jsem se naučil tento týden
===============================

(Hoping this title is proper Czech...)

I went to Prague this weekend for first time in my life and it was
awesome!  It's such a beautiful, historic, and international city. I
stayed at the [Mosaic
House](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g274707-d1656616-Reviews-Mosaic_House-Prague_Bohemia.html),
which is in "Prague 2", one of the central-ish districts of the city. It
was probably the nicest hostel that I have every stayed in.  The rooms
are super modern and relatively spacious.  Sure, you still might have to
share it with a Slovakian couple, but that's no problem at all. More
great people to meet!  It's an easy walk or tram ride from the hostel to
any of Prague's main tourist attractions.  Next time I go (cuz there
will be), I will try couchsurfing. Now that I've got a lot of the big
touristy things out of the way, I'd like to get a more local
perspective. If you have the chance to go, go. 

What to say about Dresden? It's still really great. Many of the Germans
that I meet think Dresden is awesome because it has a great young
person/student vibe and because people are free to be themselves and act
accordingly.

-   I'm fairly certain that my English is getting worse. I'm starting to
    sound like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XSeFVWqCXA).
-   Budgeting: omgwtfnoiwont. So, send me money for Christmas. Naw, I'm
    fine. Maybe.
-   Computation is hard to model in symbols and I guess that's why you
    need to use every fucking glyph imaginable: braces with dots over
    them, boxy and curvy "less/greater/thanorequalto", angle brackets,
    equals signs with all manner of shit on top of them, blah, blah,
    blah. Pretty much
    [this](http://symbolcodes.tlt.psu.edu/bylanguage/mathchart.html).
-   [Anonymous confessions of erasmus students studying in
    Germany](http://erasmusconfession.com/location.php?loc=Germany#confessions):
    "I want to confess...At first it was fun, having different girls
    every week, but at some point you have enough with the drinking and
    the random sex, remember, it's not real life, it's just 6 months in
    heaven, or in hell!"
-   A German friend told me that the Neustadt district of Dresden is
    where the most number of new families live out of any other city
    district in Germany. Like, super Noe Valley. I believe it. You can
    see TONS of little children playing at [this
    park](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=Alaunpark&data=!1m4!1m3!1d1516!2d13.7561422!3d51.0704498!4m15!2m14!1m13!1s0x0%3A0xad5494a683c7fac0!3m8!1m3!1d1516!2d13.7590497!3d51.0714239!3m2!1i1680!2i929!4f13.1!4m2!3d51.07081!4d13.7563232),
    which is also a cool spot to chill out.
-   I have a class at 7:30am on Wednesday and I want to kill myself.
-   I was introduced to the
    [Prolog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) programming language
    this week. It's going to take some getting used to.
-   I notice many people turn off their engines when stopped at a stop
    light or in traffic.  Efficiency, I guess.
-   In Prague, you can buy Absinthe that has "Thujon" or
    "[Thujone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thujone)" in it, which is
    supposed to give you some sort of added "high". I tried this
    absinthe and I would say that I did feel a bit different, maybe a
    little more relaxed (in a way that was noticeably different from
    just alcohol).  Maybe it was just my psychology reacting to being
    told that the absinthe I had contained this chemical.
-   The man that drove me to Prague said that he went there every 2
    weeks from Dresden to "film girls". I later found out that *one of
    the things* he was filming was beautiful, busty, *clothed *Czech
    women smoking cigarettes. Apparently, this is very popular in the
    U.S. Really guys?
-   You can watch naked women perform a Requiem-for-a-Dream-style,
    double-sided dildo insertion at a strip club in Prague.
-   [Karlovy Lázně](http://www.karlovylazne.cz/) ("the biggest club in
    central europe") blows. I'd like to try [Cross
    Club](http://www.crossclub.cz/cs/) the next time I go. 
-   The polizei vehicle pulls in front of you when they want you to pull
    over. The idea is that the police car is leading you to where you
    should pull over.  My ride share driver was pulled over after
    crossing the border back in to Germany. The police probably saw the
    full car and wondered what was going on. It might be a little
    suspicious when you have a Czech, a Russian, and a US American in
    your car.  In the end, everything was cool and we were allowed to
    continue without problems.
-   There is a wifi network called ["eurodam"](https://www.eduroam.org/)
    (education roaming), which allows you to connect to virtually any
    European educational institution's network. This was super handy in
    Prague where I had no cell data service.

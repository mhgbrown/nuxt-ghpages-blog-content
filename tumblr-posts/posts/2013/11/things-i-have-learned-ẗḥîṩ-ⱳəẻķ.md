cool spots in Dresden. Later in the week, my nanny from long ago Berte,
also came [from
Kiel](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!data=!4m28!3m22!1m5!1sKiel%2C+Germany!2s0x47b2560d8fee97ad%3A0x4248963c6580320!3m2!3d54.3232927!4d10.1227652!1m5!1sDresden%2C+Germany!2s0x4709cf29101ad6a9%3A0x421b1cb4288feb0!3m2!3d51.0504088!4d13.7372621!2e3!3m8!1m3!1d2997224!2d11.7982044!3d52.6650751!3m2!1i1680!2i929!4f13.1!7m4!11m3!1m1!1e1!2b1&fid=0)
to visit. It was great to see my mom and her catch up after some
twenty-some-odd years and to hear a bit about myself as a child --- at
one point Berte described me as reserved. Sort of weird for a kid.  The
whole situation felt pretty natural in the end. Berte didn't seem like
some random German lady, she was somehow a familiar and comfortable
figure.

Being with my mom again reminded me of the character of the dreams I
have been having.  I'd say it's like two worlds pulling at opposite ends
of a piece of cellophane.  It's like they're fighting for thematic
dominance and it ends up being some sort of hodgepodge, which is leaning
more toward the German one as time progresses. They're definitely not
all positive. I remember one that involved the dissolution of
relationships with people in the United States and in Germany as well.
It left me feeling shitty and alone when I awoke. Other times, shit is
just fucking confusing, for example where I "find out" that I'm in
Germany and then still don't believe it (sometimes when I'm awake it
still doesn't feel real).

-   Something that sounds like "um" means pussy in Turkish. You can
    imagine how awesome that could make some things sound.
-   And on that note, something that sounds like "natasha" means
    prostitute.
-   Volkswagen has a [transparent ("glass")
    factory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparent_Factory) in
    Dresden where they produce the Phaeton, which is a luxury car that
    only appeared for a few years in the US (I think). Inside this
    factory is a restaurant called [Lesage](http://www.lesage.de/),
    which is really fancy and nice and yummy. I'd like to go for lunch
    sometime to actually see the factory in action.
-   "[Lila Soße](http://www.lilasosse.de/)\" ist sehr lecker. Thanks
    Kristina.
-   Dresden held the [\"Unity
    Party"](http://www.unity-dresden-night.de/) this last weekend to
    celebrate the reunification of Germany. They converted a few
    downtown mall places into huge clubs. There was a *DJ and a
    dancefloor* in [a
    McDonalds](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!data=!1m4!1m3!1d3034!2d13.7357493!3d51.0430757!4m29!2m11!1m10!1s0x0%3A0xa5128371797f17e!3m8!1m3!1d26081603!2d-95.677068!3d37.0625!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!5m16!1m15!1smcdonalds+dresden!4m8!1m3!1d26081603!2d-95.677068!3d37.0625!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!17b1!27m3!1smcdonalds!2sDresden%2C+Germany!3s0x4709cf29101ad6a9%3A0x421b1cb4288feb0).
-   Speaking of McDonalds, they are much nicer here. Like, it's almost a
    classy establishment. They have this area called "McCafe", which is
    a rip off of Starbucks shoved inside a McDonalds...and it's pretty
    fucking legit --- the decor is nice, the food is looking and tasting
    good, all the fancy coffee stuff you want. I'm not sure why we can't
    get any of this stuff. Oh and it's not just like this because it's
    in a big city. I've been to hella remote ones and they are equally
    as nice.
-   The "intimacy" between males friends here is more intense than what
    I have observed or experienced in the US. it's more touchy-feely
    here.  It's sort of like if you had male friends act more like
    female friends in the US...I'm hoping that makes sense.  In the US,
    I sometimes felt like there was a weird negative undertone to
    closeness between male friends.  Maybe this is just me? I really
    don't think so though. Male friends seem a bit more distanced
    physically in the US.
-   This [vietnamese market is
    greeeeaaaaatttt](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!data=!1m4!1m3!1d3035!2d13.733942!3d51.0411434!4m12!2m11!1m10!1s0x0%3A0x9b37caf73efa08b6!3m8!1m3!1d26081603!2d-95.677068!3d37.0625!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1).
    So cheap.
-   Using "führer" is a bit taboo, obviously-ish.
-   I have a \~\* visitor \*\~ coming for the holidays. The hint is
    built into the previous sentence.

This Week, Things That Have Been Learned By Me
==============================================

Whoaaaaa, it's already the middle of November and that's freaking me out
a little bit!  Time is really starting to fucking march and that's good
and scary. [The University in Italy](http://www.unibz.it/) that is
hosting my second semester is already asking for my money and
information. This thing is happening.

I took some time this weekend to visit Hamburg and Berlin. My mom was
finishing her tour of Germany in Hamburg, staying with my second Nanny
Tanja.  I had the pleasure of staying at their house just outside the
city and getting a half-car/half-walking tour of the city.  Before
coming to Germany, I hadn't heard a lot about the city. I knew that it
existed, but not much else. Turns out it's beautiful and filled with
lots of interesting things, for example, the
[Reeperbahn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reeperbahn), which a friend
told me is the largest red-light district in Europe. It's kind of weird
(and cool) when your 40-something year-old former-nanny and her husband
are touring you around brothels and sex clubs. Unfortunately, I didn't
get a chance to check out the area on my own.  That's (one of the
reasons) why I'm going back.

In Berlin, I met up with a friend of mine (Mack) from *the era of San
Francisco* who is now living in Paris.  I arrived Saturday evening, so I
didn't have a lot of time to check out important monuments or
museums...but I did have a chance to check out dat nightlife. Mack and I
hopped some bars in
[Kreuzburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kreuzberg) (one might say [The
Mission](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_District,_San_Francisco)
of Berlin), checked out the remnants of the Berlin wall and then, on
advice from a German friend, headed to a club called [://about
blank](http://aboutparty.net/). Yup, that's its name.  The music was
awesome (great techno of course) and we had a great time. Obviously, I
still have to check out Berghain and the rest of Berlin --- be a proper
tourist. I can't wait to go back.  The city gave me a good vibe.

-   Prostitution is legal in Germany. I knew that, but like just for the
    record and your information.
    [Okrrr](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSB-5Nnw9rU)?
-   So back to the
    [ReeperBahn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reeperbahn).  There is a
    street on which no women are allowed. On this street you can window
    shop for prostitutes who are beckoning you with various calls like
    "Eine frage..." (One question...). All the women that I saw looked
    like porn stars: big boobs, crazy curvaceous bodies, unnaturally
    uniform skin tone. If there is a legit place to get fucked for
    money, this seems like it.
-   ACHTUNG! I've heard from various European sources that foreigners
    will not be allow in Amsterdam's cafes (places that sell weed) after
    the new year. So get here and hollar!
-   [Whilst In SF](http://whilstinsf.tumblr.com/) is a funny tumblr that
    describes typical SF situations with gifs. Turns out there are two
    variations for Dresden, [When You Live In
    Dresden](http://whenyouliveindresden.tumblr.com/) and [When You
    Really Live In
    Dresden](http://whenyoureallyliveindresden.tumblr.com/).
-   TU Dresden has the 2nd best Mechanical Engineering program in all of
    Europe. That's what someone told me.
-   [Cynetart](http://www.cynetart.de/?l=e) is a festival of
    computer-aided art in Dresden.  I missed a lot of the weekend
    events, but hope to catch some of it during the week.
-   DINK: Double Income, No Kids. "When we were DINKs..."
-   [Nivea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nivea) is German (wut?!) and
    headquartered in Hamburg.
-   In northern Germany, some people speak Plattdeutsch or [Low
    German](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_German), which sounds like
    German + Dutch + English. There is a chain bakery shop in Hamburg
    called [Dat Backhus](http://www.datbackhus.de/), which I think is
    "Das Backhaus" in Plattdeutsch.
-   [Glüwein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulled_wine) is hot spiced
    wine. It's delicious and a wonderful way to warm up. And an
    excellent way to get a hangover.
-   There is a thing called a
    [TreeWalker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/TreeWalker),
    which is designed to facilitate document traversal for HTML. It's
    been around for sort of a long time and it looks like it's [really
    performant](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2579666/getelementsbytagname-equivalent-for-textnodes).
     It weirds me out that I've never heard of it.

STUFF LEARNED THIS WEEK
=======================

The winter vacation is near!  I just have to do this one little, tiny,
insignificant exam *ON* *SATURDAY*, which will determine whether I'm
really cut out for this. Kind of. The exam covers all of the stuff that
I've learned about logic up to this point and it's a lot and there's a
lot I need to shove into my mind. Ok.

A German friend of mine, Lion, invited me to Berlin to show me the scene
and it was really wonderful and exhausting. The DJs from [Cologne
Sessions](http://colognesessions.com/) would be attending a house party
at the place that I was staying in Friedrichshain. I got to help set up
the party and get everything ready and then participate and drink and
eat and all that stuff --- so much good food, so many cool people, and
lots of good music. After the house party, we all headed to
[Humboldthain Club](http://www.humboldthain.com/) to watch the DJs do
their thang. They did a fantastic job and I danced my ass off till 9am
or so. And since this is Berlin, one must keep going! So, I went with a
small troupe of after-partiers to Berghain at 10am, but failed to get
in, Maybe because we had too many people. Or m*aybe *because I looked
like total shit. Who knows? We tried to go back home, but Lion didn't
have the key. So, we went to another dude's house and passed out
[listening to
this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BroXWO61duI&feature=share&list=PLinaJr6vsvqCL3tBXsN4uQzZOJtiB_2ba&index=104).
After waking, we met a very pleasant young scotsman and finished the
night with some beers, talking and listening to music. At some point
later in the night, Lion realized that he actually had the key the whole
time.

How does one write English again? It's getting expensive for me to pay
attention to proper syntax.

-   You can bathe naked in front of the patrons of a Medieval Christmas
    Market in Dresden. I know because I did this with my classmates and
    one of my professors.
-   I've heard that there might be a curfew and/or a restriction on
    having people in your room in Bolzano because our accommodation is
    within some sort of Catholic something. Not having it.
-   The word ["dollar"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar) actually
    comes from German and in fact, an area near Saxony.
-   I was exposed to [Sufism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufism) and
    [Sufi
    music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NepLzmv3VZ8&feature=youtu.be).
    Sufism was described to me as being a form of Islam that holds
    fundamental that the only way to reach god is through either love or
    music. This is quite a beautiful and peaceful notion.  These dancers
    can apparently keep spinning for hours.
-   Berghain's name is kind of stupid. It's a conjunction of "Kreuzberg"
    and "Friedrichshain", the names of two adjacent neighborhoods.

Vidz Instead
============

I stayed in Dresden for this past week, which was quite nice. I saw the
new Hunger Games with some school mates, checked out some kind of
experimental electronic music by some dudes from Chicago and New York,
got my shit organized for the next semester in Italy, and got to help a
little with cooking Cuban food. I didn't get into Sektor this Saturday,
so I am having techno withdrawal :( 

-   I will be in Budapest for New Years! I am balls excited. In Germany,
    some people call New Year's Eve
    [Silverster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvester).
-   I overheard that TU Dresden sells cocktails during the Summer.
-   There is an erotic car wash next to
    Sektor...![](https://66.media.tumblr.com/33eaa2b09945f7c9b1d51fdd524c9fb9/tumblr_inline_mxlf6nBiXv1rctsd6.png)

I wasn't very good at keeping track of the things that I had learned
this week, so I decided it might be time for some media distractions!

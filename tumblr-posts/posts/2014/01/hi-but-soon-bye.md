Hi, But Soon Bye
================

It's been some weeks again.  I'm finishing up my time in Dresden, and
for that matter, in Germany.  I'm starting to feel the weight of my
impending departure --- not excited to say goodbye to the people I'll be
leaving behind, not excited to be far from Berlin, not excited to be in
a city that's "a lesser transit hub". I'm leaving Dresden on the 17th of
February, taking a long-ass train ride to Vienna to attend a [student
workshop](http://logic.at/emclworkshop14/) for my Masters. Later, I'll
head straight for
[Bolzano](https://www.google.de/maps/preview/place/Bolzano,+Italy/@46.4892366,11.3471577,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47829c2b419e7049:0x652b694f348b432a),
where after some introductory couchsurfing, I'll find myself again
nestled in the impoverished charm of student living --- in a
[dorm](http://www.rainerum.it/home/) that "dictates" that you can only
make breakfast in the kitchen and can't have people in your room after
23:00.  What a load of total bullshit. I'll probably get kicked out. 

I spent last Saturday/Sunday in Berlin, which I realize could be my last
time in a while. As usual, had a surreal and congenial experience.  I
really want to just live it up for my last couple weeks here, but need
to balance pending examinations.  There's also a few things that I still
want to see around here --- [Saxon
Switzerland](https://www.google.de/maps/preview/place/Saxon+Switzerland/@50.9333327,14.2,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4709a6852463563b:0xe7787b6d81b3e8f0), [the
Leipzig
zoo](https://www.google.de/maps/preview/place//@51.3509575,12.3680836,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x84f9c448d8df3ff4),
and [Görlitz](https://www.google.de/maps/preview/place/gorlitz+germany/@51.13999,14.9649354,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4708dc31a78fee7f:0x5e9effc1a38b3b57) for
example. I will at most be done on the 13th of February, so I have some
time to get this stuff in.

-   I have unofficially accepted an offer to intern at
    [Sumall](https://sumall.com/) in New York City this Summer. I'm
    stoked. I need to holla at my NYC konnektions.
-   I've also manage to get some part-time work here in Dresden, helping
    someone get a prototype going for their startup idea. It's great to
    be learning some new stuff and makin some cash.
-   Some of [*Inglourious Basterds* was filmed in
    Görlitz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6rlitz#G.C3.B6rlitz_in_popular_culture).
-   Haven't written about [vk.com](http://vk.com/) yet, which is weird.
    I should have a while ago. It's like "Russian" Facebook, except it
    has tons of perhaps "questionably legal" media that you can stream
    and download for free.
-   How did I get my internship in NYC? Well, I used
    [hired.com](https://hired.com/).  You fill out a profile describing
    your work experience, what you'd like to do, blah blah blah and then

    and you should try to go. It has a wonderful vibe, great music, and
    a huge chill-out room. Just knock!

Wow, I'm almost done with this part.

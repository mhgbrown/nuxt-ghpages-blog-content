Ok, It's been a while
=====================

And so what have I learned? I don't know, probably lots of stuff that I
can't remember right now. I'm just mentally recovering from a great
winter holiday with [my bae from abroad](http://brandonhaslegs.com/). We
were in Dresden and Prague and Kiel and Hamburg (for a second) and
[Bootybest](https://www.google.de/maps/preview#!q=budapest&data=!1m4!1m3!1d208750!2d19.130303!3d47.4812135!4m12!2m11!1m10!1s0x4741c334d1d4cfc9%3A0x400c4290c1e1160!3m8!1m3!1d160430!2d13.7725857!3d51.0768338!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1)
and Berlin.  It was a wonderful time. I have a lot of friends to thank
for making it so awesome.  I spent Christmas in Dresden, just chilling
with some school friends and cooking good food. For Silvester (New
Years), I was in Bootybest, staying with German homies in [an
Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.de/rooms/1766217?checkin=30.12.2013&checkout=02.01.2014&guests=12).
 When the year turned, we were all on [Elizabeth
Bridge](https://www.google.de/maps/preview#!data=!1m4!1m3!1d3261!2d19.0490109!3d47.4910372!4m12!2m11!1m10!1s0x0%3A0xae0debf3e5578d47!3m8!1m3!1d160430!2d13.7725857!3d51.0768338!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1),
admiring the well-lit ancient [buildings looming above

Well, Ok, I'll try to remember something...

-   Bootybest is really cool and crazy beautiful. My initial judgement
    is that it's cooler and prettier than Prague. Go.
-   Hungarian is an [Uralic
    language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uralic_languages), which
    means that if you look at signs there you just kinda make a face and
    move on. I was actually frustrated that I couldn't even sort of make
    out what was going on (as opposed to Dutch or Italian). And for some
    reason, I didn't feel this way about Czech, which is just about as
    inscrutable.
-   [Lab.oratory](http://www.lab-oratory.de/)
-   Today one of our professors scolded us for not studying enough. He
    said that the results of the last big exam have so far been
    unimpressive and that we all needed to step our game way up.
     Scary. 
-   [I love this pizza place in
    Berlin](http://www.yelp.de/biz/pizzeria-zia-maria-berlin)
-   [Numbrs](https://www.numbrs.com/en/) is a really beautiful and cool
    finance management app that is currently only available in Germany.
     Unfortunately, the app doesn't fully support my bank, so I haven't
    had the chance to experience its full goodness. 
-   I've heard good things about
    [Bratislava](https://www.google.de/maps/preview#!q=bratislava&data=!1m4!1m3!1d206135!2d17.115917!3d48.1358663!4m12!2m11!1m10!1s0x476c89360aca6197%3A0x631f9b82fd884368!3m8!1m3!1d160430!2d13.7725857!3d51.0768338!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1)
    and
    [Ljubljana](https://www.google.de/maps/preview#!q=Ljubljana%2C+Slovenia&data=!4m15!2m14!1m13!1s0x476531f5969886d1%3A0x400f81c823fec20!3m8!1m3!1d208750!2d19.130303!3d47.4812135!3m2!1i1680!2i929!4f13.1!4m2!3d46.0564509!4d14.5080702).
    I'm fixin' to go.
-   A nine hour train ride is not so bad. I get the "fabled" charm of
    long train rides now.

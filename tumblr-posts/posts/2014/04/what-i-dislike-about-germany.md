What I Dislike About Germany
============================

I've been in Deutschland for almost 6 months now and it's about time I
started disliking some things! Right?!  No place is perfect (maybe).
 Unfortunately, I haven't immersed myself very thoroughly in the
political or legal arenas so I don't have many opinions there.  So I
guess I'll get right into it!

-   There are few homes with clothes dryers in them. I don't have one
    right now. I miss banging out a load of laundry in 2 hours.  It's
    annoying to have to wait 12+ hours for your favorite black jeans to
    be ready so you can go to Berghain. I can't deal with all this
    foresight! UGH! But admittedly, hanging one's clothes is not that
    bad. One benefit I am seeing is that my clothes stay the same size.
-   Paying to use a public toilet. Many public restrooms have either a
    cleaning person outside asking for money or a
    full-on-super-machine-toilet-jail-enforcer, which requires you to
    have EXACTLY 50 cents and only accepts 50 cent coins AND doesn't
    give change back. :/  BITCH, I GOT TO TAKE A SHIT, AIGHT?! A HEAVY
    URGENT MEATY BRATWURST SHIT!! You just gotta hold it or take a
    shit on the sidewalk I guess.
-   No "default" water at restaurants.  You either have to *explicitly*
    ask for tap water or in the case that they "don't have it" (yup,
    happened to me), you have to pay out your asshole for a 0,33L (tiny)
    bottle of water.  I get that this is not just a German thing. I had
    the same experience in Spain. But still, I'd like to be hydrated.
-   Grocery stores don't take credit cards. Honestly, this isn't such a
    big deal for me, but recently I am waiting for some money to come to
    me from the US and would like to buy food so I can continue living. 
-   THE COLD.  Another "not-just-Germany" problem, but it's definitely a
    thing and I definitely am not a fan.  The winter this year was even
    really mild AND I still was dying.  I guess it's the price you pay
    to live in a cool (lolololololol) place.  I'm missing that [SLO
    climate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Luis_Obispo,_California#Climate)!
     I mean, it's nice to live in a place where the weather alone can't
    kill you, right?
-   Privacy Paranoia. This is something that I noticed right away.  Many
    Germans that I've met are *super *cautious with what they share and
    put online. Many of my German friends have fake names on Facebook.
    One doesn't have a Google account at all (WOW). When Facebook bought
    Whatsapp, a few friends dropped the service completely. Like, I get
    it kind of. For me 1) the convenience of these major services
    outweighs any privacy concern and 2) I don't think these companies
    abuse my data. Advertisements based on things I like? Sounds good to
    me. Predictive search and intelligent personal assistants like
    Google Now based on my online behavior. Cool. Unfortunately, we have
    to find a way to deal with entities like the NSA [subverting
    encryption
    systems](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/us/nsa-foils-much-internet-encryption.html) that
    would be protecting our data. Everyone to the
    [darknet](https://www.torproject.org/) then? That doesn't make sense
    right now. (...trying to avoid writing a treatise on internet
    privacy)

\

But seriously, the things with the water and the toilets are my biggest
pet peeves. Every basic thing seems to be handled so well here --- food
is way cheap, healthcare is pretty well-organized, education is free
or *incredibly inexpensive *(e.g. a few hundred euros a semester at the
university), and importantly recreation/fun/party are first-class
citizens. Given all this, the effort required to have a glass of water
or take a shit seems way too high.
